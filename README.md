## Objectives 	
This project is aimed at developing the online examination system process for students and instructors. The purpose of the system is to completely automate the old manual procedure of conducting an exam to
a computerized system. The system will allow students to register and take the exam. It also enables lecturers to make tests and assign it to a link or group. The system has several functions. Both students and instructors have to register before using the system. The Instructor can add questions, take tests, and assign it. The instructor also can get a list of all students who take the exam and their grades. Once the student login to the system, he can see if he has assigned tests from groups or use a link to perform a test. After the student finishes the test, he can view his result and review his answers.
