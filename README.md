# Project Supervisor
This graduation project was carried out under the supervision of
Dr. Mostafa Herajy,
Lecturer at the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science,
Faculty of Science â€“ Port Said University.
## Objectives 	
 of the system is to completely automate the traditional manual exam process into a fully computerized system.

The system allows students to take exams without having to register themselves manually, as student accounts are created by the system administrator or instructor.

Instructors are required to register and log in to the system. They can add questions, create exams, and assign them to specific groups of students. Instructors can also view a list of all students who have taken the exam along with their grades.

Once a student logs in using the provided credentials, they can access the exams assigned to them through their group memberships only. After completing an exam, the student can view their result and review their answers.
